Cordova/Phonegap Launch Navigator Example
=================================

This repo contains an example PhoneGap 3 project which illustrates how to use the [Launch Navigator plugin](https://github.com/dpa99c/phonegap-launch-navigator) to launch the native navigation app on iOS (Apple Maps), Android (Google Navigator), and Windows (Bing Maps) to get driving directions to a desired location.

# Downloading

To download the example project, clone it using git:

    $ git clone https://github.com/dpa99c/phonegap-launch-navigator-example.git

# Building

The classic Cordova example project is in the `LaunchNavigatorExample` folder.

There's also an `IonicExample` folder which contains an Ionic example project which illustrates how to wrap the plugin API as an AngularJS service.

**IMPORTANT:** Note that the plugin will **NOT** work in a browser-emulated Cordova environment, for example by running `ionic serve` or using the [Ripple emulator](https://github.com/ripple-emulator/ripple).
This plugin is intended to launch **native** navigation apps and therefore will only work on native mobile platforms (i.e. Android/iOS/Windows).

## Android

To run the Android project either build and run the project using the Phonegap CLI:

    $ cordova run android


## iOS

To run the iOS project either build and run the project using the Phonegap CLI:

    $ cordova run ios

Note: For this to work, you need to build and install the Phonegap ios-deploy project first: `npm install -g ios-deploy`

Or import the project in Xcode and run it from there. The Xcode project is located here:

    LaunchNavigatorExample/platforms/ios

## Windows

To run the Windows project either build and run the project using the Cordova CLI (PhoneGap should work too):

    $ cordova run windows

Note: This will run the app in your Windows 8.1 PC or Windows 10 (PC). For this to work, you need at least Visual Studio 2015 Community: http://www.visualstudio.com

Or import the project in Visual Studio 2015 and run it from there. Within Visual Studio, you will be able to choose between Windows Phone 8.1, Windows 8.1 (PC) and Windows 10 (PC) Universal. The Visual Studio 2015 project is located here:

    LaunchNavigatorExample/platforms/windows/CordovaApp.sln

## WP8

To run the Windows Phone 8.0 project either build and run the project using the Cordova CLI (PhoneGap should work too):

    $ cordova run wp8

Note: This will run the app in your Windows 8.0 or 8.1 phone. For this to work, you need at least Visual Studio 2015 Community: http://www.visualstudio.com

Or import the project in Visual Studio 2015 and run it from there.

	LaunchNavigatorExample/platforms/wp8/LaunchNavigatorExample.sln

## Ionic

The `IonicExample` folder contains an Ionic example project which illustrates how to wrap the plugin API as an AngularJS service. To run it, first install the plugin dependencies:

    $ ionic state restore --plugins

Then invoke a specified platform with ionic; for example:

    $ ionic run android

# Pre-compiled app
If you're unable to build the project or just want to try it out, here is the project as a pre-built app:

- [Android APK (debug unsigned)](build/LaunchNavigatorExample.apk)
- [iOS IPA (signed for adhoc distribution)](build/LaunchNavigatorExample.ipa)
- [Ionic APK (debug unsigned)](build/IonicExample.apk)
